5. Select the **Sales Analysis.pbix** file, and then click **Open**.

6. If prompted to replace the dataset, click **Replace it**.

### **Task 4: Create a dashboard**

In this task you will create the **Sales Monitoring** dashboard. You will pin a visual from the report, and add a tile based on an image data URI, and use Q&A to create a tile.

1. In the Microsoft Edge browser window, in the Power BI service, open the **Sales Analysis** report.

2. In the **Overview** page, set the **Year** slicer to **FY2020**.

    ![Picture 4](Linked_image_Files/09-create-power-bi-dashboard_image17.png)

3. Set the **Region** slicer to **Select All**.

    *When pinning visuals to a dashboard, they will use the current filter context. Once pinned, the filter context cannot be changed. For time-based filters, it’s a better idea to use a relative date slicer (or, Q&A using a relative time-based question).*

4. To create a dashboard and pin a visual, hover the cursor over the **Sales and Profit Margin by Month** (column/line) visual.

5. At the bottom-right corner, click the pushpin.

    ![Picture 43](Linked_image_Files/09-create-power-bi-dashboard_image18.png)

6. In the **Pin to Dashboard** window, in the **Dashboard Name** box, enter **Sales Monitoring**.

    ![Picture 3](Linked_image_Files/09-create-power-bi-dashboard_image19.png)

7. Click **Pin**.

    ![Picture 1](Linked_image_Files/09-create-power-bi-dashboard_image20.png)

8. Open the **Navigation** pane, select **My Workspace** and then open the **Sales Monitoring** dashboard.

    ![Picture 44](Linked_image_Files/09-create-power-bi-dashboard_image21.png)

9. Notice that the dashboard has a single tile.

    ![Picture 45](Linked_image_Files/09-create-power-bi-dashboard_image22.png)

10. To add a tile based on a question, at the top-left of the dashboard, click **Ask a Question About Your Data**.

    ![Picture 7](Linked_image_Files/09-create-power-bi-dashboard_image23.png)

    *You can use the Q&A feature to ask a question, and Power BI will respond will a visual.*

11. Click any one of the suggested questions beneath the Q&A box, in blue boxes.

12. Review the response.

13. Remove all text from the Q&A box.

14. In the Q&A box, enter the following: **Sales YTD**

    ![Picture 11](Linked_image_Files/09-create-power-bi-dashboard_image24.png)

15. Notice the response of **(Blank)**.

    ![Picture 14](Linked_image_Files/09-create-power-bi-dashboard_image25.png)

    *You may recall you added the **Sales YTD** measure in the **Create DAX Calculations in Power BI Desktop, Part 2** lab. This measure is a Time Intelligence expression and it so requires a filter on the **Date** table to produce a result.*

16. Extend the question with: **in year FY2020**.

    ![Picture 12](Linked_image_Files/09-create-power-bi-dashboard_image26.png)

17. Notice the response is now **$33M**.

    ![Picture 13](Linked_image_Files/09-create-power-bi-dashboard_image27.png)

18. To pin the response to the dashboard, at the top-right corner, click **Pin Visual**.

    ![Picture 15](Linked_image_Files/09-create-power-bi-dashboard_image28.png)

19. When prompted to pin the tile to the dashboard, click **Pin**.

    ![Picture 17](Linked_image_Files/09-create-power-bi-dashboard_image29.png)

20. To return to the dashboard, at the top-left corner, click **Exit Q&amp;A**.

    ![Picture 16](Linked_image_Files/09-create-power-bi-dashboard_image30.png)

21. To add the company logo, on the menu bar, click **Edit**, and then select **Add a Tile**.

    ![Picture 46](Linked_image_Files/09-create-power-bi-dashboard_image31.png)

    *Using this technique to add a dashboard tile lets you embellish your dashboard with media, including web content, images, richly-formatted text boxes, and video (using YouTube or Vimeo links).*

22. In the **Add a Tile** pane (located at the right), select the **Image** tile.

    ![Picture 47](Linked_image_Files/09-create-power-bi-dashboard_image32.png)

23. Click **Next**.

    ![Picture 48](Linked_image_Files/09-create-power-bi-dashboard_image33.png)

24. In the **Add Image Tile** pane, in the **URL** box, enter the complete URL found in the **Resources\AdventureWorksLogo_DataURL.txt** file.

    *You can embed an image by using its URL, or you can use a data URL, which embeds content inline.*

25. At the bottom of the pane, click **Apply**.

    ![Picture 49](Linked_image_Files/09-create-power-bi-dashboard_image34.png)

26. To resize the logo tile, drag the bottom-right corner, and resize the tile to become one unit wide, and two units high.

    *Tile sizes are constrained into a rectangular shape. It’s only possible to resize into multiples of the rectangular shape.*

27. Organize the tiles so that the logo appears at the top-left, with the **Sales YTD** tile beneath it, and the **Sales, Profit Margin** tile at the right.

    ![Picture 52](Linked_image_Files/09-create-power-bi-dashboard_image35.png)

### **Task 5: Edit tile details**

In this task you will edit the details of two tiles.

1. Hover the cursor over the **Sales YTD** tile, and then at the top-right of the tile, click the ellipsis, and then select **Edit Details**.

    ![Picture 50](Linked_image_Files/09-create-power-bi-dashboard_image36.png)

2. In the **Tile Details** pane (located at the right), in the **Subtitle** box, enter **FY2020**.

    ![Picture 19](Linked_image_Files/09-create-power-bi-dashboard_image37.png)

3. Click **Apply**.

    ![Picture 20](Linked_image_Files/09-create-power-bi-dashboard_image38.png)

4. Notice that the **Sales YTD** tile displays a subtitle.

    ![Picture 21](Linked_image_Files/09-create-power-bi-dashboard_image39.png)

5. Edit the tile details for the **Sales, Profit Margin** tile.

6. In the **Tile Details** pane, in the **Functionality** section, check **Display Last Refresh Time**.

    ![Picture 22](Linked_image_Files/09-create-power-bi-dashboard_image40.png)

7. Click **Apply**.

    ![Picture 23](Linked_image_Files/09-create-power-bi-dashboard_image41.png)

8. Notice that the tile describes the last refresh time (which done when loading the data model in Power BI Desktop).



    *You’ll refresh the dataset in the next exercise. Typically, this would be achieved by using scheduled refresh, in which case Power BI would use a gateway to connect to the SQL Server database. However, due to constraints in the classroom setup, there is no gateway. So, you’ll open Power BI Desktop, perform a manual data refresh, and then upload the file to your workspace.*

## **Exercise 2: Refresh the Dataset**

Since the time we first designed this report, new data has been added to the database. In this exercise you will open your Power BI Desktop file, perform a data refresh, and then upload the file to your workspace. You will then receive an alert on your Power BI Dashboard, because sales have exceeded $ 35M.

### **Task 1: Refresh the Power BI Desktop file**

In this task you will open the **Sales Analysis** Power BI Desktop file, perform a data refresh, and then upload the file to your **Sales Analysis** workspace.

1. In Power BI Desktop file, in the **Fields** pane, right-click the **Sales** table, and then select **Refresh Data**.

    ![Picture 55](Linked_image_Files/09-create-power-bi-dashboard_image47.png)

2. When the refresh completes, save the Power BI Desktop file.

3. To publish the file to your workspace, on the **Home** ribbon tab, from inside the **Share** group, click **Publish** and then click **Select** to publish.

    ![Picture 59](Linked_image_Files/09-create-power-bi-dashboard_image48.png)

4. When prompted to replace the dataset, click **Replace**.

    ![Picture 31](Linked_image_Files/09-create-power-bi-dashboard_image49.png)

    *The dataset in the Power BI service now has June 2020 sales data.*

5. Close Power BI Desktop.

## **Exercise 2: Review the Dashboard**

In this exercise you will review the dashboard to notice updated sales.

### **Task 1: Review the dashboard**

In this task you will review the dashboard to notice updated sales.

1. In the Microsoft Edge browser window, in the Power BI service, review the **Sales Monitoring** dashboard.

2. In the **Sales, Profit Margin** tile, in the subtitle, notice that the data was refreshed **NOW**.

3. Notice also that there is now a column for **2020 Jun**.

    *If you don’t see the June 2020 data, you might need to press **F5** to reload the web browser.*

    ![Picture 33](Linked_image_Files/09-create-power-bi-dashboard_image50.png)

    

4. To close the pane, click **Close**.
